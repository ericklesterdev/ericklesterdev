### About

I architect and ship Android applications and modular SDKs at scale — from multi-module
SDK platforms consumed by partner apps, to consumer-facing apps serving millions of users
across 14+ localized markets. Currently driving a large-scale codebase modernization:
migrating a legacy MVP/RxJava/Dagger stack to Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, and MVVM using
AI-assisted automation I built myself.

### Currently Exploring

- **AI-assisted development** — Built custom Claude Code agents and skills that automate
  ~60% of migration work: code generation, architecture audits, compliance checks, and
  multi-gate review protocols
- **Kotlin Multiplatform** — Evaluating shared business logic across Android and iOS
- **Compose Multiplatform** — Cross-platform UI beyond Android
- **Convention plugins** — Scalable build logic with Gradle Kotlin DSL

### Featured Projects

**[android-app-shell-architecture](https://github.com/ericklesterdev/android-app-shell-architecture)**
Production-grade multi-module Android architecture with composition-first app shell, feature
isolation, and scalable module boundaries. Demonstrates how large teams structure long-lived
codebases.

**[spendpath-android](https://github.com/ericklesterdev/spendpath-android)**
Offline-first expense tracker built with Jetpack Compose, Room, Coroutines, and MVVM.
Demonstrates modern Android architecture with local-first data strategy.

### What I Bring to a Team

- **SDK architecture** — Designed and shipped a 12-module Android SDK with versioned AAR
  publishing, partner-facing wrappers, and ProGuard consumer rules
- **Large-scale modernization** — Leading migration of a production codebase from
  MVP/RxJava/Dagger/XML to Compose/Coroutines/MVVM with zero downtime
- **Multi-market experience** — Auth integrations across Google, Facebook, Line, Kakao,
  and Microsoft MSAL for apps serving global markets
- **AI-augmented engineering** — Building tooling that makes migration faster and more
  reliable, not just writing code manually
